## 1. Introduction

### 1.1. Purpose
This Developer's guide is meant to guide future developers of the project on how CAFS was developed. 
It will include the design and implementations of CAFS to give a better understanding of how to start the development of the program

### 1.2. Target Audience
The target audience of this guide are:
* Developers (Current / Future)
* Testers
* Users interested in the operations of the program

### 1.3. Description
CAFS - va CLI calender-like task scheduler that supports task and 
class schedule adding. It is simple to use, and comes with an auto-save function to 
remember your tasks.

### 1.4. Setting up
 
#### 1.4.1. Prerequisites
1. Ensure you have Java 11 or above installed in your Computer

1. IntelliJ IDE
>IntelliJ by default has Gradle plugins installed.
>Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to File > Settings > Plugins to re-enable them.

#### 1.4.2. Setting up the project in your computer
1. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to you computer

1. Open `IntelliJ` (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first)

1. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle

    * Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`

    * Click `New…`​ and find the directory of the JDK

1. Click `ImportProject`

1. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click OK

1. Click `Open as Project`

1. Click `OK` to accept the default setting. 

#### 1.4.3. Verifying the setup
1. Run the `seedu.cafs.Main ` and try a few commands.

1. [Run the tests](#5-testing) to ensure they are all set up.
 

## 2. Design
### 2.1. Architecture

![Architecture Design](images/Architecture_Diagram.jpg)

Below, we will describe the essential components that CAFS uses:

1. Main - Main component which controls the flow of execution.
1. UI - Component used for user interactions, reading in input and displaying to console
1. Parser - Component used to interpret user input and call the corresponding command
1. Command - Contains all the required implementation for the different commands
1. Storage - Reads data from, and writes date to, the hard disk
1. Exceptions - Component contains custom error handling methods for the program used by multiple other components
1. Calendar - Component containing methods to interact with date and generating a calendar
1. Task - Contains all the necessary information and implementations required to interact with the list of tasks
1. Commons - Component represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components

### 2.2. UI
* The UI component is not navigable from Command because all results from commands are passed back to main, in the form of `CommandResult`
* UI component then takes in the CommandResult object and displays the feedback from the inputted command

Here is a simplified class diagram to illustrate this interaction:

![Command Result UI](images/UiResult.jpg)

Ideally, all messages or output meant to be displayed should use the UI class instead of calling a system print or any other method.

At the moment, the only outliers are certain exception error handling messages which will be standardised to follow this principle in a later version.

### 2.3. Task Component

The TaskList Component depends on 2 other components:
1. Storage 
    * The Storage component is responsible for loading in any saved data stored locally, as well as updating the saved file 
    when changes to the task list have been made
    
2. Command 
    * The Command component executes the specific set of instructions required to fulfill a particular user command
    based on user input.

![Command Result UI](images/TaskDiagram.jpg)

The abstract class Task comprises of two subclasses:
* Class - to contain information about a class / timetable schedule
* TaskNonClass -  to contain information about all other tasks that user needs to complete or be reminded of

In total, Task component comprises of 4 classes:
1. TaskList - Methods called by commands to operate on task list. Also contains the actual list which stores all tasks.
1. Task - Abstract class to model a generic task
1. Class - Specialised class to model a student's timetable
1. Task - Specialised class to model an actionable task / todo

### 2.4. Storage Component 

The Storage component consists of a single class that parses `Task` instances to Json strings using an external library, Gson by Google. <br/>
This component,
* can load from a text file Json strings and parse them to `Task` instances 
* can parse `Task` instances to Json strings and save them in a text file

Below is a class diagram showing the interactions of this component with other classes.

![Storage_Class_Diagram](images/Storage_Class_Diagram.png)


## 3. Implementation
#### 3.1 List By Category
##### 3.1.1 Proposed Implementation
The list by category mechanism is facilitated by ListCommand which extends Command.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the mechanism behaves at each step.

Step1: The user adds a task:  `add n/2113 c/DEADLINE d/2020-03-30 t/11:59` to add a task.
Since the user adds a new category `DEADLINE`, the categoryMap wil add one more key whose value is the category and the value is
the index for this task.

Step2: The users adds a task: `add n/3145 c/CLASS` to add a class. 
Since the user adds a new category `CLASS`, the categoryMap wil add one more key whose value is the category and the value is
the index for this task.

Step3: Users list the class he just added by category CLASS: `list c/CLASS`. The TaskList will
return the index of the tasks based on the categoryMap. Then the task in the `CLASS` category
will be displayed. 

This is the Sequence Diagram for list by category. 
![Sequence Diagram for View](images/listCategorySequence.png)

This is the UML design for list by category.

![UML for View](images/listCategory.png)

##### 3.1.2 Design Considerations
Aspect: How to find certain category. 

Alternative 1 (previous choice): store HashMap to map category with the key. The map still exists which
stores the needed categories. 

Alternative 2 (current choice): linear search when searching tasks. 


#### 3.2 [Proposed] View month
##### 3.2.1 Proposed Implementation
The view month mechanism is facilitated by CalendarCommand which extends Command.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the mechanism behaves at each step.

1. The user inputs the command word `calendar`. Upon which, the instance of parser will return a CalendarCommand for execution
1. CalendarCommand initialises with the following variables, with the help from a calendar class containing the necessary methods related to day/date.
    * month - if user does not input month, it uses computer's current month
    * startingDay - which day of the week the first day of the months begins on (0-6, where 0 is Monday)
    * totalDays - how many days in that month
    * totalWeeks - number of weeks of the month
  
1. The `calendar` command calls on TaskList#findTaskDate() for each day of the month to generate the task listing for a particular day. Only the task event and description is added to calendar view. 
1. The calendar generated is then stored in a string and UI#showUserMesssage() is called to display the calendar. 

The class diagram below shows the relationships between the different classes required by the `calendar` feature.
![Sequence diagram for CalendarCommand](images/CalendarCommand_class.jpg)


The following diagram summarises what happens when a user executes a new `calendar` command:
![Sequence diagram for CalendarCommand](images/CalendarCommand_sequence.jpg)


##### 3.2.2 Design Considerations
1. Aspect: Obtaining information required for generating monthly view
  
    * Alternative 1: (current choice) Algorithm to deduce how many weeks in month, which day a date is, how many days in that month
        * Pros: Will use less memory, requiring only one starting date we are able to derive any other dates. No need to worry about changing template for the new year
        * Cons: New developers will take additional effort to understand how the algorithm works.
      
    * Alternative 2: Hardcoded information (constant variables to tell days in month/how many weeks)
        * Pros: Easy maintenance, tedious but easily calculated with web applications.
        * Cons: Tedious and not sustainable, constant updates have to be done to edit the fields for a new year

1. Aspect: Which month to use
  
    * User might want to know schedule for other months, but might also want a quick view of current month
    * Solution is to set a default month (taken from computer) and also allow input for preferred month.

1. Aspect: generation of monthly details 
  
    * Calculation of details are shifted from the command to a separate class. 
    This is to enable easier maintenance for methods relating to calendar features.
    
#### 3.3 [Proposed] Add Task / Class
##### 3.3.1 Proposed Implementation
The add `task/class` mechanism is facilitated by AddCommand which extends Command.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the mechanism behaves at each step.

1. The user inputs a correct command format:  `add n/title`.\
   Upon which, the instance of parser will return a AddCommand for execution. 
   
1. The base Command initialises with the following variables
    * taskList - manages the tasks
    * storage - updates the storage
    * ui - enable ui communication (which is not used in this command)
    
1. During the execution procedure:
    * It calls the functions in the Command which can get the fields of all the input.
    * It will then check the date/time format to see if input matches format standard.
    * If the inputs are in correct format: will add a task/class by calling the `addTask` of the _taskList_
    * Then it will call the `getList` and pass current List into storage for update
    * The newly added tasks and current taskList information will be stored in a string and pass to CommandResult. 

The class diagram below shows the relationships between the different classes required by the `calendar` feature.
![Class diagram for CalendarCommand](images/AddCommand_class.png)

The following diagram summarises what happens when a user executes a new `calendar` command:
![Sequence diagram for CalendarCommand](images/AddCommand_sequence.png)

##### 3.3.2 Design Considerations
1. Distinguish between `class` and `task`
    * By checking the input category information:
     If the category is `class`, then will add a **Class**, else will add a **Task**

1. Processing of Date,Time Format
    * Alternative 1(current): The AddCommand will check only check the basic format of input(e.g. time should be
    a range and date should not contain `/`), and then the Task class do the processing
        * Pros: The **Task** will only focus on the DataTimeFormat error and some small time range errors.
        The passing of variables is also convenient. 
        * Cons: **Task** May also need to deal with error handling. This may not be very easy to deal with. 
    
    * Alternative 2: The AddCommand will not only check the format but also check if the input is in correct
    DateTimeFormat.
        * Pros: It ensures the correctness of adding tasks, so no more error handling in **Task**.
        * Cons: May need to adjust the passing variables, and the AddCommand is dealing with 
        too much things which violates the design idea of OOP. 
    
##### 3.3.3 Future Enhancement
1. Enable `class` to store semester information so that date of class can be displayed in date format.
2. Enable repetition of `task`: e.g. Once a week, twice a week. 


#### 3.4. Storage
##### 3.4.1 Proposed Implementation
The Storage mechanism is facilitated through the Gson library implemented by Google. Tasks
are loaded from the `Main` class and saved from the  `done`, `edit`, `add`, and `delete` commands.

The interaction is similar for all the commands. Below is a sequence diagram showing the interactions between classes when a task is added to the list:
![Storage_Sequence_Diagram](images/Storage_Sequence_Diagram.png)

1. The user inputs the `add` command. After being parsed, the command is executed.
1. The `add` command adds a `Task` instance to the `taskList`.
1. After successful addition of the task, the `add` command calls the Storage#overwriteFile() to 
overwrite all the current tasks from the `taskList` to the external `data.txt` file.

##### 3.4.2 Design Considerations
1. Aspect: Saving tasks
* Alternative 1:(current choice) Overwrite all tasks in the `taskList` to the `data.txt` file when a task is edited, added, done, or deleted.  
  * Pros: Less code and easier to maintain and implement
  * Cons: Redoing work that has been done before, thus wasting resources
* Alternative 2: Save only the specific tasks that is being edited, added, done, or deleted.
  * Pros: Saves resources since it only changes one task
  * Cons: Difficult and tedious to implement since Json strings are being kept in a text file. For example, it would be hard
  to know which specific class was edited or deleted from the text file.
    
1. Aspect: How to save tasks
  * Alternative 1:(current choice) Save tasks individually as Json strings in the text file. Json strings
  are separated by new lines in the file. When loading tasks, check whether they are instances of 
  `TaskNonClass` or `Class`.
    * Pros: Avoid overflow of a single Java String since we can have many tasks in the list at a given time
    * Cons: Tedious to keep track of in the external text file
  * Alternative 2: Save the whole `taskList` as a Json string in the external text file.
    * Pros: Easy to implement both overwriting and loadings tasks from the text file.
    * Cons: May overflow a Java String faster if there are many tasks in the list at a given time.
