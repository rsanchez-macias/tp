## 3. Features

**Command Format:**
* The <UPPER_CASE> format indicates user input. However, when inputting, there is no need to input `<>`symbol. 
The `< >` symbol just for readability. 
* Command keyword (e.g. `add`) is case insensitive. However, the delimiters (e.g. `n/`) are case sensitive.
* It is okay to switch the sequence when inputting the delimiters:
    * `add n/<NAME> l/<LOCATION>` has same effects as `add l/<LOCATION> n/<NAME> `
* When inputting a time, the format is always:`hh:mm-hh:mm`. No space is allowed around `-`. 
  Also, input like `1:00-2:00` will not be allowed. 
* When inputting a date, the format is always: `yyyy-mm-dd`.
* Some recognized date/time error will be automatically parsed to accepted format.
    * `24:00` will be parsed to `23:59` since 24:00 is next day. 
    * `2021-02-30` will be parsed to `2021-02-28`


---
### 3.1. Viewing help: `help`
Displays the set of supported commands <br/>
**Usage**: `help`

### 3.2. Adding tasks: `add`
Users add tasks using this command. <br/>
**Usage**: `add  n/<NAME> t/<TIME> l/<LOCATION> d/<DATE> i/<INFORMATION> r/<REMINDER> c/<CATEGORY>` <br/>
  * Only name `<NAME>` is compulsory to include. However, if user only inputs time, 
  then date of current day will be added automatically. 
  * Space is okay in `<NAME>`,`<REMINDER>` and `<INFORMATION>`.  e.g.: `n/2113 deadline` is accepted.                                                       
  * The `<TIME>` should be in time duration format: `hh:mm-hh:mm` (e.g. `14:00-16:00`).
   There should be no space between this duration. 
  * Since a task/class may have multiple time zones in a week, students can just add list of time zones.
   However, the number of `<TIME>`should match with the number of `<DATE>`. It is suggested that 
   the number of `<LOCATION>` also match with the number of `<TIME>`. Use space to separate the time 
   zone/date/location. 
     * Example
       * `add n/CS2113 t/12:00-13:00 15:00-16:00 d/2020-07-01 2020-09-01 l/NUS NTU`  
       Adds a task with two time zones, dates, and locations.
  * If no `<DATE>` is inputted by `<TIME>` is inputted, the system will automatically add today's date
   to that task. 
  * The default category is TODO. To add a class, just indicate the category is `CLASS`. The category is
   case-insensitive.  
  * When adding normal tasks:
    * `<Date>` should be in format:`yyyy-mm-dd`
    * Examples: 
        * `add n/Project Meeting t/12:00-13:00 15:00-16:00 d/2020-07-01 2020-09-01 l/NUS NTU c/meeting`
        * `add n/2113 v2.1 t/23:00-24:00 d/2020-05-16 c/deadline`
        * `add n/Project Meeting t/12:00-13:00 15:00-16:00 l/NUS NTU i/important`
  * When adding class:
    * `<DATE>` should be the day of the week, represented by an integer (e.g. `1 3` means Mon Wed). 
    * Example:
        * `add t/11:00-12:00 01:00-03:00 n/2113 d/3 4 c/CLASS l/COM2 COM1` <br/>
        Adds a class with two time frames, two days (Wednesday and Thursday), and two locations


### 3.3. Editing tasks: `edit`
Edit the inputted task/class. <br/>
**Usage**:`edit TASK_INDEX t/<TIME> l/<LOCATION> d/<DATE> i/<INFORMATION> r/<REMINDER> c/<CATEGORY>`

* It is not allowed to edit the `<NAME>`.
* It is okay to edit the `<CATEGORY>`. However, it is not allowed to change from class category to other 
  categories. It is also not allowed to change from other categories to class category. 
* When edit `<TIME>` and `<DATE>`, please be reminded that the number of `<TIME>` should match with the 
  number of `<DATE>`. It is suggested that number of location `<LOCATION>` also matches. 
    * If you only have added one of the `<TIME>` and `<DATE>` for that task, no need to follow the 
    _number matching of TIME and DATE_ since there is only field in that task. 
    * If you have added both `<TIME>` and `<DATE>` for a task _1_:<br/>
    For example:  Previously the task _1_ is:`[TODO] Title: Project Meeting | 2020-09-10 : 11:00 - 12:00`<br/>
    When editing, can either input `<TIME>` with same number of `<DATE>` in current task _1_ : e.g. `edit 1 t/01:00-02:00`<br/>
                or input `<DATE>` with same number of `<TIME>` in current task _1_ : e.g. `edit 1 d/2020-11-12`<br/>
                or input both `<TIME>` and `<DATE>` with same number : e.g. `edit 1 d/2020-09-10 2020-09-11 t/11:00-12:00 13:00-14:00`
  
Examples: <br/>
* `edit 1 l/NUSCOM2`
* `edit 2 c/todo`  
        
### 3.4. Listing tasks: `list`
#### 3.4.1. List
Displays all the current tasks in the list. <br/> 
**Usage**: `list`
* Note that other list sub-commands (see below) will default to just `list` when input is wrongly formatted

#### 3.4.2. List by Category
List tasks that belong to a specific category. <br/>
**Usage**: `list c/<CATEGORY>`
* Wrong command: `list TODO` will have the same effects as just `list`
* The `<CATEGOTY>` is case insensitive. That is, `list c/TODO` and `list c/todo` have same effect.

Examples: <br/>
* `list c/TODO`
* `list c/DEADLINE`

#### 3.4.3. List by Time
Lists tasks and classes by specific time range. <br/>
**Usage**: `list t/<TIME>`
* `task` and `class` with a specific time range can be listed by `list t/hh:mm-hh:mm`.
List the `events` which are exactly at that time range or have a overlap at that time range.

Example: <br/>
* `list t/15:00-16:00`<br/>
 Lists the `tasks` that fall within the given time frame 

#### 3.4.4. List by Date
List tasks by specific date. <br/>
**Usage** : `list d/<DATE>`

* `task` with a specific date can be listed by `list d/yyyy-mm-dd`. Or `tasks` have date/dates in the specific dates can be listed by  `list d/yyyy-mm-dd yyyy-mm-dd ...` *(more dates)*.
* `class` cannot be listed by date since class only adopts schedule.

Examples: <br/>
* `list d/2020-06-17` <br/>
Lists the `tasks` that fall on the date `2020-06-17` 
* `list d/2020-06-17 d/2020-06-19` <br/>
Lists the `tasks` that fall on either `2020-06-17` or `2020-06-19`
    
#### 3.4.5. List by Date & Time        
Lists tasks by specific date and time. <br/>
**Usage** : `list d/<DATE> t/<TIME>`
  
* `task` with a specific date and time range can be listed by `list d/yyyy-mm-dd t/hh:mm-hh:mm`
* `class` cannot be listed by date and time since class only adopts schedule.   
* List the `tasks` which are exactly at that time range or have a overlap at that time range.
  
Example:
* `list d/2020-06-17 t/12:00-13:00` <br/>
Lists the `tasks` that fall on the given date (`2020-06-17`) and within the given time frame (`12:00-13:00`)
      
#### 3.4.6. List by Category, Date & Time

List tasks by category and date and time. 
**Usage**: `list c/<CATEGORY> d/<DATE> t/<TIME>`
* `tasks` in a specific date and specific time range in a  specific category. However, the `class` category cannot be shown, since these don't have date values.
* `tasks`  just in a specific date/dates in a specific category. However, the `class` category cannot be shown, since these don't have date values.
* `tasks` and `classes`  just in a specific time range in a specific category. All `categories` can be shown.

Examples: <br/>
* `list d/2020-06-17 t/12:00-13:00 c/todo` <br/>
Lists the `tasks` whose start time before `2020-06-17 13:00` and end time after `2020-06-17 12:00` and  category is `todo`
